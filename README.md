### About Me

Above all, I am a tenacious problem solver. [Truck stop waitress -> Princeton PhD.] With 10+ years of experience as a Data Scientist in academia, healthcare, and higher education, colleagues commend my ability to blend technical precision with empathetic communication. Families literally let me shoot lasers into their babies’ brains – for science! – because I excel at clearly explaining complex ideas.

Highlights from my skillset include:
‣ Programming: SQL, Python, R, Git, Gitlab, Bitbucket, AWS, Snowflake, Jira, Confluence

‣ Machine Learning: EDA, feature engineering, dimensionality reduction [PCA], K-means clustering, regression, classification [KNN, SVM, Random Forest, XGBoost], neural networks [CNN, RNN]

‣ Natural Language Processing [NLP]: speech-to-text, tokenization, embeddings, named entity recognition [NER], sentiment analysis, topic modeling, HuggingFace

Need an ice-breaker? Try asking me:
‣ Why should I use positive reinforcement to shape team performance?
‣ When should I use KNN instead of mean imputation?
‣ How can I teach psychopharmacology via dodgeball?
